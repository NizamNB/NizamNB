## Hi there 👋
I am Nawshad Binta Nizam, currently a graduate student in the Dept. of Bioengineering, University of Pittsburgh.

<!--
**NizamNB/NizamNB** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on **Spatial Transcriptomics** to find the correspondence between Human and Mouse mPFC brain region.
- ⚡ Fun fact: Started with circuits and electric streams, now diving into the neural dreams—shifting from engineering's spark to decoding the brain’s computational art.
- 💻 Research Interest: Applied Machine Learning/Deep Learning, Signal Processing, Healthcare, Computer Vision.
- ✈️ Enjoy traveling the world, watching football, immersing myself in music, capturing moments through camera and with the strokes of a paintbrush.
